# Not-Hesaplama

The purpose of the program is to calculate the average by entering student names and grade information, and at the same time to edit the entered grades and add them back to the list.

I created this page using html css and predominantly js.

This study helped me to understand the functional features of js programming language and the concept of DOM.
